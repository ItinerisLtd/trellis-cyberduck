## Why

Ain't nobody got time for opening up [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) files to check SFTP details. This CLI tool allows you to open SFTP connections to Trellis servers via [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) with single command.

## Usage

```sh-session
$ trellis-cyberduck open --help
Open SFTP connections to Trellis servers

Usage:
  trellis-cyberduck open <environment> [<site>] [flags]

Examples:
  $ trellis-cyberduck open production example.com
  $ trellis-cyberduck open staging my-site --user admin
  $ trellis-cyberduck open staging my-site --directory project_uploads_path

Flags:
  -d, --directory string   Directory to open. Options: project_root|project_source_path|project_uploads_path|project_current_symlink_path (default "project_root")
  -h, --help               help for open
  -u, --user string        User to connect. Options: web|admin (default "web")
```

If you have [trellis-cli](https://github.com/roots/trellis-cli) v0.10.0 or later installed, you can run it as a plugin command like so `$ trellis cyberduck --help`.

## FAQs

### trellis-cli plugin command not working
